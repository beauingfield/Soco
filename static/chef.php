					<h2>Greg's Story</h2>
					<p>Executive Chef Greg Richie is well known as the man who fronted Orlando restaurants 
					for celebrity chefs Emeril Lagasse and Roy Yamaguchi. But with Soco, he returns to 
					his Southern roots with a contemporary interpretation of one of America’s classic 
					cuisines.</p>

					<p>The award-winning chef spent his early professional years in the kitchens of renowned 
					Southern restaurants that included Magnolias in Charleston; The Abbey, Atlanta; The 
					Lark and the Dove, Roswell, Georgia; and Atlanta Athletic Club. It was in those 
					restaurants that he first gained an appreciation for carefully selected ingredients 
					and the honesty of the finished dish. Long before such terms as farm-to-table and 
					locally sourced became culinary buzzwords, Richie was practicing that philosophy. 
					"I place a strong emphasis on the integrity of the ingredients I use," he says, 
					"what I call 'thoughtfully sourced,' whether they're from accountable local growers 
					or purveyors dedicated to sustainable fishing.” Richie developed the Soco menu over 
					several years as an exciting new expression of Southern contemporary cuisine.</p>

					<p>Richie graduated with honors from the acclaimed Johnson and Wales University in 
					Charleston. He worked with Yamaguchi at the original Roy's Restaurant in Hawaii 
					and was selected to be the first executive chef/partner for Roy’s in Orlando. He was 
					then chosen by Lagasse to take over the kitchen at Tchoup Chop at the Royal Pacific 
					esort at Universal Orlando.</p>

					<p>Richie has cooked multiple times at the prestigious Beard House in Manhattan, a sought 
					after honor among chefs, and he is a charter member of SunshinePlate, a coalition of 
					chefs and culinary industry professionals dedicated to food advocacy. His awards include 
					Chef of the Year, Best Local Chef and Best Seafood in Orlando (Orlando Magazine), and he 
					was perennially named to Restaurant Forum's list of the Top 20 Chefs in Central Florida. 
					He has made numerous appearances on local and national television shows and participates 
					in food and wine charity events, including Heart of Florida United Way’s Chef's Gala and 
					Share Our Strength's Taste of the Nation.</p>
